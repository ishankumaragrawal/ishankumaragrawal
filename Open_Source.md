1. Refactored code to move the data dispatch step to base class - reduce a lot of repeated steps in derived logger classes
2. Added feature to log state attributes along with metrics in Loggers.
3. Combined State Attributes with Metrics so that they can be handled together.
4. Added ROUGE metric for batch calculation.
5. Added the state attributes and corresponding tests for
	- Tensorboard
	- Polyaxon
	- Tqdm
	- ClearML
	- WandB
	- MLFlow
	- Visdon
